# dashboard-templates
A repository of dashboard templates, for use in pathogen surveillance activities (especially wastewater-integrated surveillance). 

Each of the subdirectories of this repository includes a fully functional, Plotly Dash based web-ready dashboard, which can be modified as needed for public health use. If you aren't familiar with Plotly Dash, we recommend first working through the [Dash tutorial](https://dash.plotly.com/tutorial). 

For testing purposes, each of these scripts can be run using `python app.py`. However, for real-world deployment purposes you'll want to use a production WSGI server such as gunicorn.
